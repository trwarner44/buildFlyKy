                <h2>From Lift-Off to Landing: The Science Behind the Fun</h2>
                <p>In a world where technology moves faster than ever, drones have landed front and center in classrooms as a fun, hands-on way to dive into STEM. Imagine students mastering physics as they fine-tune a drone’s flight path, exploring engineering by snapping together parts, or even learning to code as they program a perfect circle mid-air. Drones are more than gadgets—they’re a gateway to understanding the science and tech shaping our world. In our workshops, we’ll take flight into STEM with activities that get students thinking, building, and (most importantly) having a blast!</p>

                <h2>STEM in Action: What Drones Teach About Science, Tech, and Beyond</h2>
                <p>When students engage with drones, they’re not just flying a fun gadget; they’re diving into real-world STEM principles. Here’s a quick look at some of the core concepts:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physics</strong>: Drones provide an up-close lesson on the principles of flight—lift, thrust, drag, and gravity. Students can experiment with these forces in real time, adjusting angles and speeds to see how their actions affect movement.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Engineering</strong>: Building a drone involves hands-on skills and problem-solving, from assembling parts to understanding how different components work together. Students develop practical knowledge of circuits, sensors, and mechanics that make drones operate.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Programming</strong>: With drones, students learn coding basics by programming specific flight paths. Whether it’s looping in a circle or navigating an obstacle course, coding provides a great introduction to logic, sequence, and debugging.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Mathematics</strong>: Flight paths, speed, and angles all involve calculations. Through drones, students learn how math underpins real-world applications, from geometry in path planning to algebra in adjusting flight dynamics.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Electronics</strong>: Understanding how batteries, circuits, and electronic components power drones introduces students to basic electronics. They’ll explore concepts like voltage, current, and power distribution, gaining a practical feel for what makes technology work.</li>
